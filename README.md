# Django_REST-React
This repository contains all my work on both technologies Django and React. 

## Current project
> This project is test. There I try new features and different techniques. 

There are three directories: 
 - images 
 - my-app
 - rest-api_example 

### *my-app* - this is react application.
### *rest-api_example* - is django REST api. 
This is backend of the application. Here I create api with json files. So far, there are two models: Users and Drinks. Drinks model has all data about drinks (id, name, description and url to image). Users model will contain users of the application. So, there will be stored each user (id, name, email, password). 

### *images* - folder with all images.
All images of drinks are stored in that folder. Urls which are stored in Drinks model are route to that folder.
